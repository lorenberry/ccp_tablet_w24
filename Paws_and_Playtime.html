                </div>
                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
                <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                    <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the mailman and squirrels every single day. Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.</p>
